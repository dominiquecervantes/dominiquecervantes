### Hi there 👋

Hi 👋 My name is Dominique Cervantes
====================================

Software Engineer | Python + SQL | Monitoring + Observability
-------------------------------------------------------------

From teacher to tech in 1.5 years, I started learning by teaching my elementary and middle school students. While an educator, I volunteered my time from 2019-2021 to other teachers with regard to IT problem solving. Furthermore, I started building Python and SQL. This turned into a genuine interest and eventually a formal role as a Software Engineer. For the past two years I have hardened, configured, monitored, secured and improved the architecture using Python, SQL, and SCADA tools such as Inductive Automation software and Canary Labs + Axiom. My day to day consists of the monitoring and observing of time-series data, configuring MQTT modules across 100+ servers with TCP/IP, SSL/TLS, HTTP(S), and gRPC to ensure that data available to subscribers and published efficiently via MQTT. Recently, I've successfully revived and reimplemented a dashboard to monitor server health. I am currently involved in the migration process from VM and hardware to hot/cold storage in the cloud using Azure DevOps and other tools which is also teaching a great deal about containerization, microservices, and orchestration. I am in charge of preparing and communicating the analytics that justify the hot/cold decision, which requires me to communicate technological language to various involved departments with excellence and effectiveness. In essence, I can explain complex subjects simply and get people to rally for a win-win solution.
